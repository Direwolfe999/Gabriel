PROMPT FOR RESUME LOGIC:::

Analyst background with his CEO/Founder role at Send-Eat.

The "Full Data-Driven CEO" Integration Prompt
Copy and paste this into Copilot along with the resume text you just provided:

PROMPT:
"I am developing a premium executive portfolio for Gabriel Johnson. I am providing his full professional resume.

Your Task: Integrate the details from this resume into the portfolio structure we have established, but elevate the language to reflect his status as the CEO & Co-Founder of Send-Eat.

Integration Instructions:

The 'Data-Driven CEO' Narrative: Use his experience as a Data Analyst (Power BI, Tableau, SQL) to explain how he built Send-Eat. Highlight that Send-Eat isn't just a delivery app; it is a data-driven ecosystem optimized by his expertise in geographic sales analysis and customer behavior.

Project Section Upgrade:

Instead of just listing 'Adidas Dashboard,' frame it as: 'Expertise in Global Scale Logistics & Sales Tracking.'

Integrate the 'Global Start-up Funding Landscape Analysis' ($5.89B) as proof of his ability to handle investor-grade data and venture capital environments.

Experience Sync: - Combine his Web Developer experience at Blue Marvel Capital (London) and his Marketing Executive background to position him as a 'Full-Spectrum Tech Founder' who understands Backend, Frontend, and Growth Hacking.

Mention his leadership at Midtown Tech Hub as evidence of his commitment to the Edo State tech ecosystem.

Skills Visualization: - Group his technical skills into: Strategic Data Intelligence (Power BI, Python, SQL), Full-Stack Engineering (Backend/Scalable Systems), and Growth Operations (Meta Ads, ROAS optimization, CRM).

Send-Eat 1.0 Connection:

Link his 'Customer Segmentation' project directly to the Send-Eat goal of a '48%+ repeat order rate.'

Use his Computer Science degree from University of the People to solidify his technical authority.

Tone: Executive, High-Performance, and Visionary.
Design: Ensure all projects are displayed using the 'Premium Peak' Glassmorphism cards we discussed.

Please rewrite the Hero, About, Projects, and Experience sections using the specific data points from the resume I just shared."

How this improves the Portfolio:
The "Why": Most founders just have an idea. Gabriel has the data. This prompt forces Copilot to show that Gabriel built Send-Eat based on $500K+ sales insights and geographic heat-mapping.

International Appeal: By highlighting Blue Marvel Capital (London) and University of the People (USA), Copilot will make the portfolio look globally competitive, not just local.

The "Concierge" Logic: His Marketing ROAS (3-12x) experience proves he knows how to get customers, and his Data background proves he knows how to keep them.
