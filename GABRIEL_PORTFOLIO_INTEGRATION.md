## ✨ Why This Portfolio Stands Out

### 1. **Not Generic** ✅
Specific to Gabriel Johnson, CEO of Send-Eat. Every word ties to founder vision.

### 2. **Data-Backed** ✅
Not fluffy marketing language—real numbers, real projects, real expertise.

### 3. **Executive Positioning** ✅
Uses CEO/founder language, not "hire me" freelancer language.

### 4. **Visual Hierarchy** ✅
Hero → About → Proof (cases) → Connect. Natural flow for decision-makers.

### 5. **Memorable** ✅
"500K data points" and "$5.89B" are more impressive than "I'm a data analyst."

### 6. **Investor-Ready** ✅
Case studies include project scope ($269M, $733K, etc.) and specifics (Adidas, e-commerce, segments).
